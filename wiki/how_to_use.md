# Sorting
With **Nemo's Inventory Sorting**, you get buttons to sort items from A–Z or Z–A, move identical or all items, and drop items.  
There are two ways to use these buttons:

## Mouse
Simply click the buttons, or **Shift-click** to include items in the hotbar.

## Keyboard
First, you need to set the key binds (they are unbound by default), which you can find in the key bind settings.  
Once configured, press the key bind — or **Shift + key bind** — to include hotbar items.

# Item Filter
Click the search bar to start searching for an item.  
You can search by **item name**, **custom name**, **enchantments**, or even for items inside **bundles** and **shulker boxes**.  
Click outside the search bar to stop searching.
